Implement the Runge-Kutta Method (RK4): Develop a Python script to solve initial-value problems (IVPs) using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta Method (RK4). This involves creating a function that returns arrays of t values and approximate solutions w for the given differential equation y'=f(t,y).

Test and Compare Solutions: Test the implemented RK4 method on a specific IVP y′=y−t^2+1 with given initial conditions. Compare the approximate solutions with the exact solutions and visualize the results using graphs.

Solve Additional Problems: Use both Euler's Method and RK4 to solve additional problems from the textbook. Plot the solutions from both methods along with the exact solutions on the same graph for comparison.

Analyze Step Size Effects: Use the code to solve another IVP y′=e^t cos(t) with different step sizes (h=0.25, h=0.1, and h=0.01). Compare these results to those obtained using Euler's Method and discuss the differences.

Report Writing: Document the process and results in a LaTeX report.

This project aims to provide hands-on experience with the Runge-Kutta Method for solving differential equations, enhance understanding of numerical methods, and improve skills in programming, error analysis, and technical reporting.
